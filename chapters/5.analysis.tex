\section{Exploring and analyzing data}

% How are data analyzed, which technique(s) are used,
% i.e., Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? What do you want to explore and investigate in
% data sets? summarize their main characteristics.

In this project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be used to explore the data patterns, it is an essential approach in data science, it involves datasets' investigation and summarize their major characteristics by visual methods. It emphasizes patterns discovery, testing assumptions, and identifying relationships between variables with assumptions. Its methods include univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate visualization \cite{ibm_eda}. 

Another method is descriptive data analytics (DDA), it also known as descriptive analytics, it leverages historical and raw data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships to figure out what has occurred in the past. It follows the process including collecting data, cleaning data and visualization. Its core techniques includes aggregation, data mining clustering algorithms, etc.\cite{tableau_descriptive_analytics}.

In the next sections, the time range of dataset will be selected from 1997 to 2004, because this dataset started from 1997, but it just includes data until May 2025, so, for the fairness of results, the data of 2025 is not used in this experiment.

\section{Dataset}

% Where is the source of the dataset? Describe the process and effort required if you do significant work to get or convert the data into the proper format. The description does not have to be lengthy, but it must be clear and well-defined. Include the main steps necessary to complete the project.

To support my motivation, the dataset should be lived and from the real firm, holding the major position in the gaming sector. According to the report review at the start of this report, I chose "Steam dataset" from \textbf{Kaggle} \cite{kong2023steam}. Depend on the description of this dataset and my practice, it offers a comprehensive collection of metadata of 111,452 unique samples from 1997 to the middle of 2025. This JSON-formatted resource captures essential details such as game names, release dates, genres, categories, user ratings, unit price, etc. And it contains some noise data, such as not standard-format string.

Obviously, this structure of data cannot be used to query by specific SQL for checking out the useful information or insights. The tree structure is hared to access for collecting activities. So, we need the process to flatten it into two dimensional tables with rows and columns first, but this will lose the relationship between fields, so, we need to connect them by techniques such as foreign key and intermediate table. During flattening process, the necessary cleaning procedure is also needed for high quality database. Finally, the effort includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design the schema of the target database.
    \item Design and program the translate script.
    \item Design the clean strategy and implement it.
    \item Implement the quality assurance for handling errors for reviewing and correcting.
    \item Verify the results.
    \item Design visualization charts to demonstrate the insights.
\end{enumerate}
